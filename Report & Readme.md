# Coursera_Capstone

#### Hi, there is a python project focusing on data science. I am still working on it.
#### BTW, I don't know how to trust the notebook to show the map I created. Anyone knows how to solve it? Thanks in advance! :)

#### In this project, I will focusing on finding the similarities of neighbours among Downtown Toronto, Downtown New York City, and Downtown Beijing. Although the culture, the location, and the economic status may influence the similarities of those three cities, I want to drive some insights about common points from my analysis. Then, I will give some recommendation about which kind of interests or neighbours are popular among those big cities around the world based on the analysis. 

#### The data will be downloaded from the Internet. The datasets will contain the boroughs, neighbourhoods, coordinates information of Toronto, New York City, and Beijing.

#### Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
#### Results section where you discuss the results.
#### Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
#### Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
