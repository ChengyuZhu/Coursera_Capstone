#### Hi, there is a python project focusing on data science. I am still working on it.
#### BTW, I don't know how to trust the notebook to show the map I created. Anyone knows how to solve it? Thanks in advance! :)

### 1 Introduction
#### In this project, I will focusing on finding the similarities of neighbours among Downtown Toronto, Downtown New York City, and Downtown Beijing. Although the culture, the location, and the economic status may influence the similarities of those three cities, I want to drive some insights about common points from my analysis. Then, I will give some recommendation about which kind of interests or neighbours are popular among those big cities around the world based on the analysis. 

#### 1.1 Backgroud
#### Nowadays, the globalization is developing rapidly. Beijing, Toronto, and NY City are top biggest cities around the world. Beijing is located far from Toronto and NY city, and it's a city with different culture and economic status compared with Toronto and NYC. Toronto and NYC are much similar, but there is still different since the policy, the people and the season are quite different from each other. Beijing, Toronto, and NYC are representative cities of Asia and North America.
#### 1.2 Business Problem 
#### There are lots of companies which want to start their global business. However, the markets around the world are similar and dissimilar in the meantime. Thus, to understand which kind of business or whether to open the stores in a particular city is very important for every company which decide to focus on the global market (especially among Asia and America). To analyze the similarities of Beijing, Toronto, and NYC (as the representatives of big cities) can help those companies to understand the different situations and decide which kind of business branch is worth investing.


### 2 Data description
#### The data will be downloaded from the Internet (including wikipedia and json files and csv files downloaded from open data source). The datasets will contain the boroughs, neighbourhoods, coordinates (latitudes and longtitudes) information of Toronto, New York City, and Beijing. 
#### Boroughs: I will only keep boroughs related to downtown parts of those three cities.
#### Neighbourhoods: neighbourhoods will be used to create clusters.
#### Coordinates: Coordinates including data of latitudes and longtitudes, which will be used to plot maps.


##### Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
##### Results section where you discuss the results.
##### Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
##### Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
